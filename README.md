# 🏢 Conference Room Booking System

This repository contains a project with the base code for a Conference Room Booking System.

This system will allow employees to search a list of available rooms and book a room for use.
There will be an administrator login portal giving them access to the administrator dashboard in the future.
There will also be functionality for a receptionist to book on behalf of another person and for facility managers to book a room for maintenance.
The code has been laid out with room for expansion for these features.

This code will eventually be merged with existing API endpoints and documentation.
